----------------------------------------------------------------------

Please prepend each .apk file with "beta_" and append it with "_vX_X".
For example, if we were testing the Uploader app on version 3.2, we
would call the .apk file
      beta_uploader_v3_2.apk

Add all .apk files to be tested to the "Tests" directory and
list your file to be tested in this .txt file.

IF YOUR APP IS NOT LISTED HERE, IT WILL NOT BE TESTED.

After testing any application listed here, please leave your name and
a brief response as to how the app test went in the comments section
below.  Sample .apks and comments are provided.  Please follow the 
same format to keep things consistent.

beta_sample_app_v5_0.apk

John Doe: app test went smoothly, no bugs
Bob Brown: the recording button isn't wide enough

beta_other_app_v2_1.apk

John Doe: I made the app force close: reproducable by recording data,
hitting the power button, and turning the device back on.
