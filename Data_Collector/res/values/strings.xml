		be updated from time to time, without prior notice, and any such changes shall be effective as 
		soon as posted. If applicable, you should also refer back to the Terms of Service and Privacy 
		Policy on a regular basis so that you remain aware of the most current terms and conditions that 
		apply to you.\n
		
		\n1. LICENSE GRANT. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Developer hereby 
		grants to you a limited, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, non-assignable and revocable

		and its affiliates in connection with your use of the Application and the Services, which shall 
		include, without limitation, all technical information about your device, system, Application 
		software, peripherals and the use thereof, shall be governed by and subject to the terms and 
		conditions set forth in the Privacy Policy.\n
		
		\n4. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS. Developer, its affiliates and/or their respective licensors own all right, 
		title and interest in and to the Application, including, without limitation, all intellectual and 
		proprietary rights appurtenant thereto, and, except for the limited license granted to you herein, 
		nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to restrict, transfer, convey, encumber, alter, impair 
		or otherwise adversely affect Developer’s, its affiliates and/or their respective licensors’ ownership 
		or proprietary rights therein or any other of Developer’s, its affiliates’ and/or their licensors’

		defective, you assume the entire cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction. Some 
		jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitations on applicable 
		statutory rights of a consumer, so the above exclusion and limitations may not apply to you.\n
		
		\n6. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. To the extent not prohibited by law, in no event shall Developer 
		or its affiliates be liable for any loss or damage of any kind, whether direct, indirect, 
		incidental, special, exemplary or consequential, including, without limitation, damages for 
		loss of profits, loss of data, data charges, business interruption or any other commercial

		connection with your use of the Application. You are solely responsible for any data 
		access or other charges you incur.\n
		
		\n9. CONTINUED USE OR AVAILABILITY. Developer and its affiliates reserve the right to modify, 
		update, supplement, limit, discontinue, remove or disable access to the Application and/or 
		any Services without notice to you and neither Developer, its affiliates nor any of their 
		respective licensors shall be liable to you or any third party should it exercise such rights.\n
		
		\n10. UPDATES AND UPGRADES.  You are only granted the right to the version of the Application 
		as provided when purchased and solely incorporating the features and functionality provided 
		with such version.   You are not granted any rights to any updates, upgrades, future versions, 
		modifications, supplements, and/or additional features and components (including any 
		online or external functionality or Services) of the Application that may subsequently 
		be made available by Developer with the Application or for use with the Application 
		(collectively the Updates).  From time to time, Developer may make available Updates to 
		the Application via software download or other means. Such download may occur automatically 
		without the need for any act on your part, or it may require you to manually download an 
		update or upgrade through the same source from which the Application was originally 
		downloaded. Certain functions of the Application may be modified or discontinued as a 
		result of any such update or upgrade, or may not be available if you have not downloaded 
		all Updates made available by Developer or otherwise.  Developer may, in its sole and 
		absolute discretion, provide you free of charge with Updates to the Application but reserves 
		itself the right to charge additional sums for such Updates the amount of which shall be 
		determined by Developer in its sole and absolute discretion.  Developer does not warrant, 
		represent nor undertake to provide Updates and in no event shall Developer incur any liability 
		for a failure to do so.  Developer may, in its sole and absolute discretion, by means of 
		Updates or otherwise, offer Services as a complement to the Application and reserves itself 
		the right to charge additional sums for same, including a monthly or yearly fee or a fee 
		based on usage.\n
		
		\n11. CHANGES TO THE AGREEMENT. Developer may make changes to this Agreement, at any time 
		and from time to time, by notifying you of the change, including, without limitation, 
		by including notice on the Services or by other electronic means, and a new copy of this 
		Agreement shall be made available on the Services. By using the Application and/or any 
		Services after such changes are made to the Agreement, you signify that you agree to be 
		bound by and comply with such changes and Developer shall treat your use as acceptance of 
		the changed provisions.\n
		
		\n12. TERMINATION. This Agreement is effective until terminated by you or Developer. Your 
		rights under the license granted herein shall terminate automatically without notice from 
		Developer if you fail to comply with any terms or conditions of this Agreement. Upon 
		termination of this Agreement, you shall cease all use of the Application, and destroy 
		all copies, full or partial, thereof.\n
		
		\n13. GOVERNING LAW AND INTERPRETATION. To the extent not prohibited by law, you agree 
		(i) that this Agreement and all disputes, claims, actions, suits or other proceedings 
		arising hereunder shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the substantive 
		law of the state of Massachusetts (ii) to irrevocably submit to the sole and exclusive 
		jurisdiction of the courts of Massachusetts, and (iii) to irrevocably consent to the exercise 
		of personal jurisdiction by such courts and waive any right to plead, claim or allege that 
		any of the judicial districts of Massachusetts, USA is an inconvenient forum. No failure or 
		delay by Developer, its affiliates or licensors to exercise any right or enforce any 
		obligation shall impair or be construed as a waiver or ongoing waiver of that or any or 
		other right or power. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or 
		unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall be unimpaired and remain in 
		full force and effect. You may not assign your rights under this Agreement without Developer’s 
		prior written permission and any attempt by you to do so shall be void. Any provision of this 
		Agreement which by its nature must survive the termination of this Agreement in order to 
		give effect to its meaning shall survive such termination. You agree that Apple is an 
		intended third party beneficiary of this Agreement and will have the right to enforce this 
		Agreement as a third party beneficiary.\n

	<string name="syncTime">
	    Synchronizing time is useful when using multiple devices on a ride at the
	    same time.  By default, many Android devices\' clocks will not match one
	    another\'s, thus making recording data at similar times difficult.  However,
	    you have a choice to fix this issue by setting a device as a \"host\".
	    This can be done by hitting the \"Send\" button.  Upon hitting \"Send\", 
	    the time from that particular Android device will be broadcasted as a timeframe
	    that all other phones in the local network can receive.  However, in order for
	    a phone to receive a broadcasted time, that phone must be currently in 
	    receive-mode, which can be done by hitting \"Receive\".  In other words, if
	    you intend on receiving a host\'s time, you must be in receive-mode before the
	    host hits \"Send\". (By default, \"Send\" will also receive the time that you have 
	    broadcasted, should you be the host).  After pressing either \"Send\" or 
	    \"Receive\", a dialog box will tell you the time that has been received from
	    the host, along with the millisecond offset between 
	    the received time and your Android device\'s actual clock.  If you do choose 
	    to synchronize time, recording data will now use the received time as a label 
	    for data points, rather than using your local time.  This now allows 
	    simultaneous data recording across multiple devices on the same ride at the 
	    same time.  Please note: synchronizing time will only work if all the Android
	    devices are connected to the same WiFi network.  Mobile plans (e.g. 3G or 4G)
	    generally will not allow for synchronizing time.  Also, synchronizing time may not be
	    allowed on some WiFi networks, but it generally works on small, password-secured 
	    WiFi networks.

	    This is a guide designed to help explain to you how to use our iSENSE Data 
	    Collector application.

		\n\nYou may have already noticed the initial splash screen (the previous 
		window you were viewing before coming here).  This screen will allow you 
		to navigate to, in addition to this guide, information regarding what this 
		application is useful for along with the End User License Agreement (EULA).  
		The EULA must be accepted in order to use this application. You can view the 
		accepted status of the EULA by looking for the check-mark next to the EULA 
		prompt: checked means accepted, unchecked means declined.  From here, you may 
		continue into the application itself via the “Continue” button, or exit 
		anytime by using the “Exit” button or hitting the “back” key on your Android device.

		\n\nYou’ll know when you’re in the main application when you see a lot of 
		red - a red iSENSE logo, button colors, borders, and more.  We’ll get more 
		into what this red means later.  The initial screen displays our logo, two 
		textboxes that state your current username and session name, a label for time 
		elapsed, a large button that states “START”, and a prompt informing you to use
		 the menu key to access app configurations.

		\n\nLet’s start with the in-app menu, and namely, the username.  If you navigate to 
		our in-app menu, you’ll see 5 options.  These include “Setup”, “Login”, “Upload”, 
		“Sync Time”, and “Media”.  By selecting Login, you’ll be shown a dialog box that 
		prompts you for a username and password.  You do have an iSENSE account, right?  
		Here’s the place to enter those credentials.  If you do not have an iSENSE account, 
		visit our website, isenseproject.org, and create an account through the login-screen.  
		If your credentials are validated, our application will log you in and be allowed 
		to post data/media to the iSENSE website as your account.

		\n\nThe menu’s “Media” option is great for those who want to take pictures and/or 
		videos to upload to their iSENSE session.  The layout is relatively simple - you 
		may take a picture, a video, go back, and view the amount of media taken/recorded 
		for the current session.  These pictures and videos will be saved to your SD Card, 
		and the pictures only (iSENSE does not currently support videos) will be uploaded 
		and appended to your session on iSENSE after you record data.

		\n\nAnother particularly useful menu option is “Sync Time”.  Clocks between multiple
		Android devices will all vary, at least by a few seconds.  This makes simultaneous
		data recording relatively difficult.  As a result, we have implemented our 
		“Sync Time” feature for you.  Selecting this feature will bring you to a whole 
		new yellow-themed layout which will further explain how to use this incredibly
		useful feature.

		\n\nBefore recording any data with this application, you must “setup.”  This can be 
		done through the menu or by holding the “START” button prior to setting up the current 
		session.  After experiment data has been loaded, you will see a dialog labeled “Step 
		1: Identify Session”.  Here, you will enter the name you want to give the session you 
		are going to record, the experiment you want to upload the data to, and the interval 
		(in milliseconds) between each recorded data point.  You may enter an experiment 
		number manually, should you know your experiment’s ID number off the top of your head, 
		or you could use one of two additional features.  “Scan QR Code” will allow you to 
		scan the QR Code that was generated on the associated experiment’s homepage and grab 
		its experiment number and sample interval for you.  Of course, you are still welcome 
		to change any of those credentials at any point.  Don’t have a QR Code scanner 
		application?  No problem!  Our application will re-direct to the Google Play Store 
		where you can download the latest version of the recommended QR Code scanning application.  
		“Browse&#8230;” will allow you to scroll through a list of all existing experiments on 
		the iSENSE website and select the one you’d like to use.

		\n\nWhen you’re done setting up we will gather the associated fields from that 
		experiment and display another dialog, labeled “Step 2: Select Fields”,
		where you may see every field that this experiment can accept data for.  
		Each listed item in this dialog box will tell you the name of the field, 
		whether or not your phone is compatible (able to record this type of data), 
		and whether or not you want our application to record that type of data.  If 
		you do not want a particular field recorded, here’s your chance to de-select 
		it.  WARNING:  There is a chance that our application will tell you that your 
		phone is compatible to record particular data fields, but some phone releases 
		do include the sensors included with other devices of the same release.  
		Therefore, we may still not be able to record that type of data, even if you 
		do check off that list item.  Additionally, our application may tell you that 
		you do not have an appropriate sensor to record a field when in fact you do.  
		Again, this is due to a minor inconsistency between devices built on the same 
		Android version, so you may still choose to attempt to record this field if you 
		think you have the appropriate sensors.  There is no harm in checking/un-checking 
		fields to record.  If you attempt to record a field you cannot, iSENSE will fill 
		each data point with a “0” by default.  In other words, our application should 
		not melt, explode, die, or force close should you attempt to record an 
		incompatible field.  Note the keyword “should”.

		\n\nIf Step 2 doesn’t bring you back to Step 1 to choose another experiment 
		(which will only occur if you chose a broken, non-existent, or absolutely 
		incompatible experiment), then you will find yourself back on the main screen.  
		What now?  You may begin recording data!  Press and hold the “START” button, 
		and your device will vibrate, beep, and turn green.  While the application is 
		green, it means that data is currently being recorded.  Additionally, the 
		“Time Elapsed” label will begin incrementing, showing you how much time has 
		passed since you’ve begun to record data.  That means that while the application 
		is red, data is not recording.  You may stop recording data at any time you’d 
		like by holding down the same button you pressed to begin recording (which 
		will now be labeled “STOP”).

		\n\nYou are at this point brought to the last step, Step 3, where you may 
		enter a description for the session you are about to upload your data and 
		media to.  As stated by the prompt in this dialog, this step is optional.  
		You may choose to leave the description blank and upload (in which the session 
		description will become “Automated Submission Through Android Data Collector App”), 
		or you may choose to describe the data you had just recorded.

		\n\nAfter hitting upload, our application performs magic, and, should no 
		error messages pop-up, presto!  Your session data and media will now be hosted 
		live on the iSENSE website under the experiment you chose to upload data to.

		\n\nFollowing the upload (or even if you cancel the upload), you will be displayed 
		a summary of the data you have recorded, including the elapsed time, the amount 
		of data points recorded, the end date and time, and the name of the .csv file 
		that has been saved to your SD Card that includes all of your data.

		\n\nThat is our application in a nutshell!  However, there are still many other 
		features and errors that you may encounter.

		\n\nWhen you initially reach the home screen, a dialog box may pop-up telling you 
		to enable GPS satellites.  This is required if you would like to allow our 
		application to record Latitude and Longitude data (otherwise, you may close this dialog).

		\n\nIn order to upload data to iSENSE, you must have both an internet connection 
		(via WiFi or mobile connectivity [e.g. 3G or 4G]) and you must be logged in.  
		If neither of these cases are satisfied, an error message will tell you to 
		check internet connectivity and to remember to login.  After both of these 
		issues are resolved on your behalf, you may access the “Upload” feature from 
		the in-app menu to attempt to upload that data set and media again.  WARNING: 
		If you record another data set before uploading the previous one, the previous 
		data set WILL be lost.  

		\n\nMiscommunications with the iSENSE server may happen and cause your data/media 
		to fail to upload.  Don’t worry though - we have already stored a file in your 
		SD Card, called uploadqueue.ser (DO NOT TOUCH, unless you want to potentially 
		break this feature), that will store all of your failed-to-upload data.  
		Upon finally receiving a successful upload, should there be any existing 
		failure-data, a new window will display a list of all failed uploads from 
		the past that you may now try to upload yet again.  Once all of them have been 
		uploaded, this list will no longer appear.

		\n\nCRITICAL: Permission to write to the SD Card is absolutely crucial to this 
		application.  Be sure to enable us to do so.  Otherwise, we may not save any 
		of your pictures, videos, or data on the SD Card, we will be unable to upload 
		any pictures to your session, and you will disable the feature that allows you 
		to re-try uploading previously failed-to-upload sessions.

		\n\nOther features of this application should be self-explanatory as they happen.  
		However, if you have any questions or comments regarding this application, our 
		contact info may be found in the EULA (so be sure to read it!)

		\n\nThank you for choosing to use our application - we hope you enjoy it!
