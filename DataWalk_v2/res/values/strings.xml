    <string name="app_name">iSENSE Data Walk</string>
    <string name="aboutApp">\n\nThis app enables you to record your GPS location continuously while walking outdoors and allows you to share that data online. When the app is activated, your GPS coordinates are saved once every 10 seconds and are then shared on the iSENSE web system (isenseproject.org), where they can be viewed publicly. In order to allow you to find your contributed data easily, the app asks you to enter your first name and last initial. If you are not comfortable with this information being posted on the web, please refrain from using this application.\n\nInstructions:\n\nIn order to begin recording and sharing data, press and hold the button that says \"Hold to Start.\" This allows data to be recorded and saved every 10 seconds (provided that the GPS on your mobile device has a satellite fix). When you are ready to stop recording, press and hold the button that says \"Hold to Stop.\" While data is being recorded, you will not be permitted to exit the app by pressing the Back button. However, pressing the Home button will interrupt the recording. When the app resumes, a dialog box will appear indicating that data recording was halted.</string>
    <string name="saveMode">Save Mode</string>
    <string name="saveModeInstructions">* Turning on Save Mode will allow data to be saved until internet is enabled.</string>
